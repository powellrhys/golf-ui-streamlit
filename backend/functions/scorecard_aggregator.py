    Aggregates golf round data from blob storage by hole number and organizes it

    This class extends the `BlobClient` to interact with Azure Blob Storage,
    reading scorecard files, extracting hole-level information, and exporting
    aggregated summaries for each hole. Data is sorted chronologically (most
    recent first) to support time-series analysis of golf performance.
